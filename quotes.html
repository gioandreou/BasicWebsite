						<p>It is paradoxical, yet true, to say, that the more we know,
						the more ignorant we become in the absolute sense, for it is
						only through enlightenment that we become conscious of our limitations.
						 Precisely one of the most gratifying results of intellectual evolution
						 is the continuous opening up of new and greater prospects.</p>
					</th>
					<th>
						<p>I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the
						human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation
						 of the brain unfolding to success... such emotions make a man forget
						  food, sleep, friends, love, everything.</p>
					</th>
					<th>
						<p>Let the future tell the truth, and evaluate each one according to
						 his work and accomplishments. The present is theirs; the future,
						 for which I have really worked, is mine.</p>
					</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>
						<p>Today's scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments,
						 and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually
						 build a structure which has no relation to reality.</p>
					</th>
					<th>
						<p>Every living being is an engine geared to the wheelwork of
						 the universe. Though seemingly affected only by its immediate
						 surrounding, the sphere of external influence extends to infinite distance.</p>
					</th>
					<th>
						<p>Electrical science has revealed to us the true nature of light,
						 has provided us with innumerable appliances and instruments of
						 precision, and has thereby vastly added to the exactness of our knowledge.</p>
					</th>

				<tr>
					<th>
						<p>Our virtues and our failings are inseparable, like force and matter.
						When they separate, man is no more.</p>
					</th>
					<th>
						<p>Modern science says: &#39;The sun is the past, the earth is the present,
						 the moon is the future.&#39; From an incandescent mass we have originated,
						 and into a frozen mass we shall turn. Merciless is the law of nature,
						  and rapidly and irresistibly we are drawn to our doom.</p>
					</th>
					<th>
						<p>The scientists of today think deeply instead of clearly.
						 One must be sane to think clearly, but one can think deeply and be quite insane.</p>
