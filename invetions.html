				<h3>1. Alternating Current</h3>
				<p>The DC current that Edison had been working on was costly over long distances,
				and produced dangerous sparking from the required converter (called a commutator).
				Nikola Tesla&#39;s alternative was: Alternating Current.Tesla responded by demonstrating
				that AC was perfectly safe by famously shooting current through his own body to produce light.   </p>
				<h3>2. X-rays</h3>
				<p>Electromagnetic and ionizing radiation was heavily researched in the late 1800s, but Nikola
				Tesla researched the entire gamut. Everything from a precursor to Kirlian photography, which has
				the ability to document life force, to what we now use in medical diagnostics, this was a transformative
				invention of which Tesla played a central role.</p>
				<h3>3.Remote Control</h3>
				<p>This invention was a natural outcropping of radio. Patent No. 613809 was the first remote
				controlled model boat, demonstrated in 1898.  Utilizing several large batteries; radio signals
				controlled switches, which then energized the boat&#39;s propeller, rudder, and scaled-down running
				 lights. While this exact technology was not widely used for some time, we now can see the power
				 that was appropriated by the military in its pursuit of remote controlled war. </p>
				<h3>4.Electric Motor</h3>
				<p>Nikola Tesla&#39;s invention of the electric motor has finally been popularized by a car brandishing his name.
				While the technical specifications are beyond the scope of this summary, suffice to say that Tesla&#39;s invention
				of a motor with rotating magnetic fields could have freed mankind much sooner from the stranglehold of Big Oil.
				However, his invention in 1930 succumbed to the economic crisis and the world war that followed. Nevertheless,
				this invention has fundamentally changed the landscape of what we now take for granted: industrial fans, household applicances,
				water pumps, machine tools, power tools, disk drives, electric wristwatches and compressors.</p>
				<h3>5. Laser</h3>
				<p>Nikola Tesla&#39;s invention of the laser may be one of the best examples of the good and evil bound up together within the mind of man.
				 Lasers have transformed surgical applications in an undeniably beneficial way, and they have given rise to much of our current digital media.
				However, with this leap in innovation we have also crossed into the land of science fiction.  </p>
